American Football: An Analytical Approach

Class project for MSIS 4263: Decision Support Systems and Business Intelligence Applications

Final Grade: A

Group Members: Aaron Carmichael, Lavada Blanton, Robert Underwood, Levi Taylor

Repo contains the final pdf of our writeup and powerpoint of this project as well as screenshots of the SAS model and decision tree for clarity. Because this project used the SAS EM, there is no actual code to be shared. 

Purpose: Use the SAS EM to analyze data over all plays run in the NFL between 2009 and 2018 to find what plays are more likely to result in a touchdown. Our goal is to be able to predict the likelihood of touchdowns.
